  <p>I am on a vacation with my parents, my brother, and my wife. We are traveling
  in a white passenger van. The journey is through a part of the country that is
  less developed but not backwoods - roadside farm stands interspersed with small,
  single-story office buildings. The look of the trees suggest Serengeti but I know
  we are in America. It is perpetually dusk. Somehow I find myself alone outside of
  the van - I donâ€™t know how but i have the feeling I was accidentally left behind.
   I turn and a low, insistent flood is approaching. It seems too viscous but is
   clearly water. I climb one of my savannah trees to keep myself from the flow.
   Now the waters are gone leaving a rich, loamy earth that is not muddy and I
   need to catch up to my family and help them avoid the flood, or at least warn
   them about it. Somehow I believe that I will be able to outpace the water and
   find them on the road ahead. There is no emergency in this; no one is in true
   danger.</p>
