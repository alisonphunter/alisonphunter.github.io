    <p>I dreamed I was a kid again and I removed my shoulders in a bathroom. I had
    been smoking so I dropped my cigarette inside a toilet which was hopelessly
    clogged. After the third failed flush, I spent the rest of the dream counting
    the dozens of collapsed toothpaste tubes that came sliding out. </p>
