 I went to Japan to visit Mike Henshaw. There was a huge dragon fruit in a stall
 larger than a bowling ball. Mike bought 150 lbs of meat and wanted me to help
 him carry it home. I was like, what the fuck dude, you know I'm vegan. We sat
 on a bench with some of his students across from a shop frequented by hijra.
 There was a gully behind us. I heard a strange bird in a tree. It was a huge
 white swan chasing a huge white crane. Couldn't figure out if they were mating
 or fighting.
