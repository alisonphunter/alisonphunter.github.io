  This great self referential dream that started with being able to hug someone
  and transfer my soul, and then some people came in that were enemies but they
  didn't realize my soul had transferred so i was able to trick them for a bit,
  but then it turned out we were all stuck in the same thing and decided to work
  together, the two of them had worked out how to save people and reconstitute
  themselves and others with some device that could store people in watermelons
  (sometimes, other things too) and then play back the decay/reconstitution in
  time (like rewind fast forward), then the four of us went on the wild looping
  david lynch like journey trying to work our way out of the system. Ikepy
  experiencing the same part from the viewpoint of different characters and
  each looping experience was adding more to it. At one point I went through
  this long thing with Joe Connelly on the phone pretending to be a phone
  operator that was fooling with him. Right after that it turned out that the
  four of us were actually some kind of game makers, maybe we were stuck in the
  game. Brilliant game makers. We'd somehow stuck ourselves in the game? There
  was a scene with people smashing giant boxes in three story recycling bins.
  There was a scene where we were practicing a play/show (one that we'd already
  seen, we were in,m the beginning) and we had to leave the warehouse/theater and
  cross a parking lot by rolling hula hoops before us, making sure there was
  always a hole we were passing over. The we couldn't find our car, but got in
  a cab driven by another enemy, but we thought we could trick him. The cab was
  more like a short hearse and a junler inside. I woke up soon after.
