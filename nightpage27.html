   <p>
barney rubble (cartoony dream) was walking down a mountain trail when a giant
redwood log fell and started sliding down the path. It managed to pick him up
(hooked his clothes in the back) and started taking him on a crazy ride down
the trail. occasionally swinging out perpendicular to the trail and knocking
down a bunch of trees. He passed some friends, rather alarmed. After awhile
he sees a burning house across a lake, the tree swings out and he smashes
through the house window and out the other side. as he swings back onto the
trail you see he grabbed a bunny in the house and lets it hop off safely. Later
he and the tree are joking. The tree says, hey go get us some beers and swings
him over to a convenience store. Then they show him and the tree going across
the great plains, racing trains, etc.... off into the sunset.</p>
