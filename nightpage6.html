The most vivid, recurring dream I can recall (again, I rarely remember any of
this), comes from extreme childhood; we're talking 10 years old. A figure
bearing a striking resemblance to a creature from Where the Wild Things Are
sits at a small campfire, surrounded by trees, seemingly alone. A solitary
spider slowly cascades down from the frame and stops in the line of sight of
our protagonist. His eyes become transfixed and begin to swirl, his jaw slacks
in fearful awe. He remains as such for a few moments - I wake up in tremendous
dread and a cold sweat.
