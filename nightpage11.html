  morning of fb 25<br>
  I'm at a club, something like a performance theater, in San Francisco. It is
  small and very dark. Only the stage is lit up, and that just barely. I'm in the
  front row, slouched on a sofa facing the stage. A "band" comes onstage
  consisting of people i know and like but usually only see at tech conferences
  (like boris and justin) but none of them actually looked like anyone i knew
  exactly. The band strips naked and starts going into strange poses and
  contortions as the lights go very dim (one guy plays with himself getting a
  huge erection (like 20 inches), except for the lead singer who I think was
  justin hall, but not, stands at the mic saying something along the lines of
   "do not be afraid, but don't make eye contact with any of them. they might
   ...see you(? actually I forget exactly what he said, but something along
   those lines)." <br>
  At this point he makes eye contact and barely whispers "i think i see dav
  coleman." He and eye stare at each other for 10 seconds or so and I make a
  slight wave to him as the lights go completely dark. The 'band' never actually
  played any insturments, they just went into this weird dance routine sort of
   thing as recorded music played
  it is pitch black for maybe 10 seconds, when the lights come back up (still
  only very slightly) the stage looks empty, but as the lights dim again I just
  notice that they are all lying still on the stage as if playing dead. There
  is another brief period of utter darkness and then the lights come up again
  just barely and I see dark shadows moving. There is a swarm of men and women
  (mostly women) in strange burning man-ish vaudeville costumes streaming out
  from the stage area and into the audience, moving slowly and either crawling
  or crouched. As they pass by they make long eye contact with the audience (me).
  The lights dim again and as they come up there is a man I feel like I know and
  recognize (but I don't really, he kinda looks like Mie's ex daniel) and I get
  just a glimpse of him falling down over me with a sheet over both of us and
  another man (whom I don't feel like I recognize at all but he kind of looks
  like the Hedwig actor at the end of the movie) joining him before it goes pitch
  black again. At this point there is some soft weird music playing. The two men
  put my toes in their mouth and I realize they are resting their hands on my
  crotch. I "remember" at this point that I had filled out an audience form when
  I had entered the theater stating among many other answers to various questions
   that foot sex really turned me off, and I realize that this was all part of
   the personalized performance. They were hoping to excite me with what i said
   was a turn off, or make me confront it maybe. The problem is, I wasn't getting
    excited and I really wasn't enjoying the "foot sex" it fact it kind of hurt.
    And i was wearing socks. And I'm not gay. So i endured it for awhile, never
    getting aroused even when some women behind me grabbed my hands and were
    caressing them and whispering something unintelligible in my ear, when finally
     the guys gave up and came up and asked what they were doing wrong in a
     friendly kind of familiar way as if we were old friends. Oh,and the guy on
     the right, the one I didn't recognize at all, had man boobs that he was
     apologizing about and i was like "hey it's ok guys, no biggie" i didn't feel
      weird about it, you know i'm hip and all, but i was kinda glad it was over.
       I was also kinda glad I didn't get turned on!
  Then i woke up<br>
  The weird thing of course is, toe sucking is normally a turn on for me, ha
  I also am really intrigued by the "remembering" something earlier in the dream,
  because I'm pretty sure that I never actually filled out a form in the dream up
  until the point that I "remembered" doing it, but it felt just like any other
   memory.<br>
  As I was writing the above scene down, I remembered earlier in the dream I was
  in a residential/shopping high rise complex, taking an elevator and had to
  squeeze in a weird position with some others (I sort of had to push myself
  into a rack of clothes that were in the elevator to make room for a girl in
  an electric wheelchair). After I got off unlike the 115th floor there was some
  girl from the elevator ride who was flirting with me, but i politely blew her
  off because I have Mie and went walking down a huge glass walled corridor
  trying to get "home" but realizing i was lost, then i was flying at night
  down a street while walking a dog. I landed and was talking with some funny
  hot latina chicks in catholic school girl outfits. Then i went into the club.
  Before the "band" came on there was some interaction with a movie/theater
  company in planning stages of a production that involved re-mixing old footage
  of an actress as a child (very Jodi Foster like) with new footage of her as an
   adult, so she played both characters. then the show above started.
