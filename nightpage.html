  <p>I dreamed I was a kid again and I removed my shoulders in a bathroom. I had
  been smoking so I dropped my cigarette inside a toilet which was hopelessly
  clogged. After the third failed flush, I spent the rest of the dream counting
  the dozens of collapsed toothpaste tubes that came sliding out. </p>

  <p>Hanging out with Bernie at rallies in the forest. Rolled dad's car but got
lucky and NO damage. </p>

With breakfast's left over bacon I assemble a salad of escarole, butter leaf,
shredded radish, and gorgonzola.  I head over to Anthony Lombardo's for a
preplanned salad potluck.  I am eager to tour his new apartment and enjoy
some full and varied conversation.  Arriving, I join him in his kitchen where
he is assembling his own salad with large chunks of firm vegetables; yellow
onion, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and ranch dressing.  I'm critical of his
cutting things to the same size and shape, feeling that variety is significant.
 I notice a lithe blonde walking between rooms down the hall.  She has a unisex
haircut and is wearing an oversized t shirt. She rubs her eyes sleepily as she
enters the bathroom.  As she closes the door, I lean towards Anthony and whisper
 "are you fucking her or is she helping pay rent?"  With wide eyes he exclaims
 "Both!" as if he, himself, can't believe it.   Another person joins us at the
  table with a homemade macaroni salad.  It was recently made and hasn't had
  time to completely cool.  I never look at their face but they are familiar
  to me.  After lunch we talk for a long time. Half way through one of Anthony's
   customary blunts I remember I don't smoke marijuana any longer and am
   incredibly disappointed in the slip up.

I had a dream that Aladdin’s brother and I went to see Hamilton which was not
starring Reggie Watts but before it was time to watch Hamilton Reggie Watts
tried to get me high. We had front row seats.
</p>

<p>Rapid fire through my shirts hung up in my closet and I had 7ish of the same one.</p>


<p>Dad and I playing (but actually in) a video game like GTA that involved two
dudes breaking out of jail and stealing a train.</p>

<p>I am on a vacation with my parents, my brother, and my wife. We are traveling
  in a white passenger van. The journey is through a part of the country that is
  less developed but not backwoods - roadside farm stands interspersed with small,
  single-story office buildings. The look of the trees suggest Serengeti but I know
  we are in America. It is perpetually dusk. Somehow I find myself alone outside of
  the van - I don’t know how but i have the feeling I was accidentally left behind.
   I turn and a low, insistent flood is approaching. It seems too viscous but is
   clearly water. I climb one of my savannah trees to keep myself from the flow.
   Now the waters are gone leaving a rich, loamy earth that is not muddy and I
   need to catch up to my family and help them avoid the flood, or at least warn
   them about it. Somehow I believe that I will be able to outpace the water and
   find them on the road ahead. There is no emergency in this; no one is in true
   danger.</p>

<p>Friend of mine in real life who lives in the Caribbean and makes his living
doing market speculation (also Canadian) heard my dad was gonna start working
at American Apparel and said "if he has half a brain I can use somebody to do
x" (data entry or number crunching) and I'm in the awkward position to say
"well...dad would not be good at this"...</p>

<p>met a vc he took me in a ride in his car but he was driving crazy all up and
down this street, almost ran into a backhoe and was talking about money and i
was saying "I don't really care about the money" and then the meeting started
and todd siegel was there we were standing in a field and I was talking about
wanting to go to a water slide. it was a neat trick.<br> Later the VC sent me
an email and there was a still picture of that field and
embedded in the picture at exactly the right spot was a video of us all talking
(shot from the back so I didn't know we were being recorded) and I was talking
about the waterslide.</p>

<p>I dreamed I was a broad pink line. I was being drawn slowly and tightly
  alongside a thinner closed gray line that maybe had a shape. There was ash
  and leaves in the center in a pile. I didn't reach the beginning of myself
  before I woke up.</p>

<p>I'm at a club, something like a performance theater, in San Francisco. It is
small and very dark. Only the stage is lit up, and that just barely. I'm in the
front row, slouched on a sofa facing the stage. A "band" comes onstage
consisting of people i know and like but usually only see at tech conferences
(like boris and justin) but none of them actually looked like anyone i knew
exactly. The band strips naked and starts going into strange poses and
contortions as the lights go very dim (one guy plays with himself getting a
huge erection (like 20 inches), except for the lead singer who I think was
justin hall, but not, stands at the mic saying something along the lines of
 "do not be afraid, but don't make eye contact with any of them. they might
 ...see you(? actually I forget exactly what he said, but something along
 those lines)."<br>
At this point he makes eye contact and barely whispers "i think i see dav
coleman." He and eye stare at each other for 10 seconds or so and I make a
slight wave to him as the lights go completely dark. The 'band' never actually
played any insturments, they just went into this weird dance routine sort of
 thing as recorded music played<br>it is pitch black for maybe 10 seconds,
 when the lights come back up (still only very slightly) the stage looks empty,
 but as the lights dim again I just
notice that they are all lying still on the stage as if playing dead. There
is another brief period of utter darkness and then the lights come up again
just barely and I see dark shadows moving. There is a swarm of men and women
(mostly women) in strange burning man-ish vaudeville costumes streaming out
from the stage area and into the audience, moving slowly and either crawling
or crouched. As they pass by they make long eye contact with the audience (me).
The lights dim again and as they come up there is a man I feel like I know and
recognize (but I don't really, he kinda looks like Mie's ex daniel) and I get
just a glimpse of him falling down over me with a sheet over both of us and
another man (whom I don't feel like I recognize at all but he kind of looks
like the Hedwig actor at the end of the movie) joining him before it goes pitch
black again. At this point there is some soft weird music playing. The two men
put my toes in their mouth and I realize they are resting their hands on my
crotch. I "remember" at this point that I had filled out an audience form when
I had entered the theater stating among many other answers to various questions
 that foot sex really turned me off, and I realize that this was all part of
 the personalized performance. They were hoping to excite me with what i said
 was a turn off, or make me confront it maybe. The problem is, I wasn't getting
  excited and I really wasn't enjoying the "foot sex" it fact it kind of hurt.
  And i was wearing socks. And I'm not gay. So i endured it for awhile, never
  getting aroused even when some women behind me grabbed my hands and were
  caressing them and whispering something unintelligible in my ear, when finally
   the guys gave up and came up and asked what they were doing wrong in a
   friendly kind of familiar way as if we were old friends. Oh,and the guy on
   the right, the one I didn't recognize at all, had man boobs that he was
   apologizing about and i was like "hey it's ok guys, no biggie" i didn't feel
    weird about it, you know i'm hip and all, but i was kinda glad it was over.
     I was also kinda glad I didn't get turned on! Then i woke up <br>

As I was writing the above scene down, I remembered earlier in the dream I was
in a residential/shopping high rise complex, taking an elevator and had to
squeeze in a weird position with some others (I sort of had to push myself
into a rack of clothes that were in the elevator to make room for a girl in
an electric wheelchair). After I got off unlike the 115th floor there was some
girl from the elevator ride who was flirting with me, but i politely blew her
off because I have Mie and went walking down a huge glass walled corridor
trying to get "home" but realizing i was lost, then i was flying at night
down a street while walking a dog. I landed and was talking with some funny
hot latina chicks in catholic school girl outfits. Then i went into the club.
Before the "band" came on there was some interaction with a movie/theater
company in planning stages of a production that involved re-mixing old footage
of an actress as a child (very Jodi Foster like) with new footage of her as an
 adult, so she played both characters. then the show above started.</p>

 <p>Green Toyota Corolla (from atl).</p>

<p>
i was flying over a city, on some sort of boogieboard like craft, doing loops
and rolls, etc. Very fun. Then i landed near Sean Savage who was driving his
 RV. I got in the RV with him and Parker. We drove around and then Sean got
 stuck in a water fountain because he wasn't driving the RV very well. I
 got out with Parker to help him backup and stuff, but the RV kept getting
 worse. Running over people’s bikes and hitting cars, etc. Finally the RV drove
  forward and I saw Sean wasn't driving it anymore, it was some woman. She took
   off in the RV and Parker and I gave chase through crowded urban streets.
    After a long time of trying to figure out where the RV went (since it got
    away) we found it parked outside someone's house. We jumped in and started
    it up, and then saw the woman run out of the house and get in a little
    beater car and take off. I looked in the back of the RV and saw that my
    laptop (and Sean) were missing. I drove off in the RV to chase her, and
    it was a wild chase because it’s hard to chase a little car in an RV down
    steep curvy roads. I managed to keep up though, and she ended up doing a
    big loop and going back to her house. I parked and ran into the house to
    confront her. I was by myself now, Parker had disappeared somewhere when
    we were chasing the car. Inside she was pacing manically and muttering. I
    told her I wanted my laptop back, and she started talking some crazy stuff
     I didn't understand. When I looked at her, her face was multi-dimensional,
     fluttering, like I was on some kind of psychedelic drug that kept me from
     being able to focus on her face.  She seemed to be Vietnamese and seemed
     crazy like a bag lady. Then her two teenaged sons came out and joined in
     the confrontation. Out of nowhere one of the sons hit me with the neck,
     trying to stab me. He seemed to think he had sliced open my neck, but I
     thought I had blocked him before he could really do damage. Then he told
      me they'd already killed Sean, which pissed me off and I somehow didn't
      believe them. I started to fight back then, trying to kill the brothers,
      but woke up before it was resolved.

<p>
This great self referential dream that started with being able to hug someone
and transfer my soul, and then some people came in that were enemies but they
didn't realize my soul had transferred so i was able to trick them for a bit,
but then it turned out we were all stuck in the same thing and decided to work
together, the two of them had worked out how to save people and reconstitute
themselves and others with some device that could store people in watermelons
(sometimes, other things too) and then play back the decay/reconstitution in
time (like rewind fast forward), then the four of us went on the wild looping
david lynch like journey trying to work our way out of the system. Ikepy
experiencing the same part from the viewpoint of different characters and
each looping experience was adding more to it. At one point I went through
this long thing with Joe Connelly on the phone pretending to be a phone
operator that was fooling with him. Right after that it turned out that the
four of us were actually some kind of game makers, maybe we were stuck in the
game. Brilliant game makers. We'd somehow stuck ourselves in the game? There
was a scene with people smashing giant boxes in three story recycling bins.
There was a scene where we were practicing a play/show (one that we'd already
seen, we were in,m the beginning) and we had to leave the warehouse/theater and
cross a parking lot by rolling hula hoops before us, making sure there was
always a hole we were passing over. The we couldn't find our car, but got in
a cab driven by another enemy, but we thought we could trick him. The cab was
more like a short hearse and a junler inside. I woke up soon after.

<p>C Street but more space between houses</p>

<p>
  "Go tell 'em girl" my great-grandmother kept telling me. I hadn't seen her since
  I was five years old and she died when I was twelve, but here she was standing
  behind my nineteen year old self just before that night.<br>

  I almost didn't do it. I almost kept that secret to myself, but great-grandma
  kept pushing me. She was excitable, she was concerned, she was loving. I was
  scared. I held to the secret for so long, I didn't know how to let it out.<br>

  "Do it now girl, do it now" she whispered as she laid her warm, but firm
  hands on my shoulders. </p>


<p>
Dream starts and I'm in a public bathroom in some mall area. A dude comes in
and he's acting all sketchy, he's up to something. He goes into a stall and
does something with stuff he brought in, then goes back out and I hear some
kind of chaos. He made some kind of disturbance. He comes back in and shows
me this thing that's like a shopping cart that he's modded to be a mechanical
 push rotating mop thing. It's weird. Anyhow, now the cops have the bathroom
 surrounded and I don't want them coming in because they'll get me too for
 something. So I pull out a big thing of smoke bombs and fireworks, have a lot
 of trouble getting it all lit at once but I do and toss it out the door. The
 dude and I slip out amid the chaos. At first we separate as we try to blend in,
  walking away from the scene.<br>
There's cops all over the place though. We end up being near each other again
and pushing through a crowd in some building. Cops have the building surrounded
 and as I go down the steps I realize we shouldn't be seen together, as the
 dude stands out in the crowd because he's black and we're in some kinda white
  suburban area, so I put my hand on the shoulder of a woman in front of me,
  hoping that she'll think I'm just using her for support because the crowd
  is pushing and shoving, but the cops will think I'm with her.<br>
At some point I realize she's someone I know, a friend of a friend. She seems
to get what I'm doing and pretends to be my lover as a show for the cops. We
make out for a bit and slip by the cops. Later I'm at her apartment. We're
still kind of going at it. Then the scene jumps and I'm at some club party,
by myself. I'm taking photos, sitting on a couch and it's loud and people are
dancing all over. I end up in some cuddle puddle with some people, make out
with some girls, then go to leave. I end up having to go back in, because in
typical dream fashion I realized I left without most of my clothes, so I
wandered back in my boxers and gathered all my stuff.<br>
I get back to that girl's apartment and there are cops all around it, but they
seem to be focusing on a building next door so I slip in unnoticed. The girl
isn't in there, but there are some people on the balcony overlooking the
street. I get to the balcony and Toni is there with Jon Stewart and some other
people. Jon asks me to get him a beer. They're watching the Extra Action
Marching Band perform in the street. The band is mixed in with all the SWAT
cops, going through their routine as they push through the cops. That's,
unfortunately, when I wake up.<br>

Toni Tran was a housemate at my De Haro place

barney rubble (cartoony dream) was walking down a mountain trail when a giant
redwood log fell and started sliding down the path. It managed to pick him up
(hooked his clothes in the back) and started taking him on a crazy ride down
the trail. occasionally swinging out perpendicular to the trail and knocking
down a bunch of trees. He passed some friends, rather alarmed. After awhile
he sees a burning house across a lake, the tree swings out and he smashes
through the house window and out the other side. as he swings back onto the
trail you see he grabbed a bunny in the house and lets it hop off safely. Later
he and the tree are joking. The tree says, hey go get us some beers and swings
him over to a convenience store. Then they show him and the tree going across
the great plains, racing trains, etc.... off into the sunset.</p>



<p>I dreamed last night about a group of friends training for a volleyball
tournament and they had a kangaroo (on the team) that kept eating all their
other pets. I saw the kangaroo hop up a slope and eat a rabbit and a kitten
in one gulp.
</p>

<p>My friend Chris Lattner died in a car accident. I was involved in driving a car
 back to help. Drove through Tennessee where there were mammoth sized luxury homes
 and magic mountain theme parks.</p>

 <p>
 I went to Japan to visit Mike Henshaw. There was a huge dragon fruit in a stall
 larger than a bowling ball. Mike bought 150 lbs of meat and wanted me to help
 him carry it home. I was like, what the fuck dude, you know I'm vegan. We sat
 on a bench with some of his students across from a shop frequented by hijra.
 There was a gully behind us. I heard a strange bird in a tree. It was a huge
 white swan chasing a huge white crane. Couldn't figure out if they were mating
 or fighting.
 </p>

<p>

This is what I remember today of a dream I had about 34 years ago.  It's about
 our friend Pam.  As in Alison Pauline Hunter, and it accrued to me several
 days after she died in a plane crash.  Her plane, a big PSA commercial jet,
 descending  over San Diego, had clipped a small private plane and there were
 no survivors.  No survivors except all the people who loved all the people
 who died.<br>

Pam was in our kitchen and it was early morning and  the sun was bright
oming through our kitchen window  and she was talking, in her animated way
about her own death and what had happened after she died.  I remember that
her arms were bare and that she hugged herself as if she had a chill and she
said, My God, they had to send my teeth to Boston for ex rays. They had to
compare my teeth with my old dental records. It's horrible. And my poor parents.
And then the there was a shift in my dream and it was later and she was
telling me how odd it was to be in stores now and pass by the registers
and not have to pay.  You don't pay.  It's just so strange.  She said.
And then there was another shift, and we were still at our house, our house
on Red Bud lane, and it was evening now and there as a kind of party going on.
And the house was dark with shadows.  And people were begining to leave,
beginning to drift off in different directions and I wondered where Pam was.
And I found her in a corner.  A dark corner by herself and she was quiet and
withdrawn. And I kissed her.  I put my lips to hers and her lips hardly moved
at all but her breath came into me. Something passed into me and I felt, It
is over. It is over now.
</p>

<p>
The most vivid, recurring dream I can recall (again, I rarely remember any of
this), comes from extreme childhood; we're talking 10 years old. A figure
bearing a striking resemblance to a creature from Where the Wild Things Are
sits at a small campfire, surrounded by trees, seemingly alone. A solitary
spider slowly cascades down from the frame and stops in the line of sight of
our protagonist. His eyes become transfixed and begin to swirl, his jaw slacks
in fearful awe. He remains as such for a few moments - I wake up in tremendous
dread and a cold sweat.

Strange Advice
July 12th, 2005
I dreamt that I was sneaking through Bill Gates’ house with a friend.
We hadn’t been invited, but we hadn’t broken in and we hadn’t planned this
adventure. (Looking back, I’m not sure how that could be. Perhaps we found
a door that had been left open?)<br>

As we slinked around this dark expensive house, Bill strode in and flicked on
the lights. He didn’t seem surprised to see us. He offered us each a drink and
showed us around the place a bit.<br>
He said a few small-talk things. He glanced at me, offered me an opening to
speak. I froze and couldn’t say anything. That’s what always happens when I’m
face to face with a celebrity or a legend: I freeze up. Later I always kick
myself because I didn’t say things that I should have.<br>
As I pondered this Bill said:<br>
“If you freeze up in front of a famous person and you know that later you’ll
remember 100 things that you should have said, you should say:
‘I freeze up in front of famous people. Later I’ll think of 100 things that I
 should say now.   But I can’t say them now.’<br>
That will break the roadblock.”<br>
At “roadblock” I awakened with hot sunlight in my face.<br>
I closed the blinds. I tried to go back to sleep and speak to Bill Gates but
I couldn’t.<br>
I’m not Bill’s biggest fan, but I’ll try those words next time I meet Jeff
Bezos or Satan or Jesus.
</p>

<p>Taking college class philosophy or history (something unusual for me but I was
excited about it). Leave Miriam at him for a bit to go with S and C to a cafe
to talk about it. </p>

<p>
I went to David Bowie's funeral. We were best friends. He rented out a huge
 synagogue in San Francisco and he knew he was dying so he went to his own
 funeral. He took a cyanide pill that would kill him in 15 minutes. He got
 into a cocoon like bed that was slowly raised vertically over the stage
 while his final song played and everyone watched him die. It was completely
 tragic and beautiful.
 </p>

<p>
I  got Ryan Gratzer killed. We were riding bikes around LA and I said let's cut
 through this back area where there were hundreds of destitute homeless men
 lying on swampy grass. We retreated but a young man followed us and had a
 long carving knife attached to a piece of drywall. He attacked Ryan and I
  disarmed him but we both got stabbed. Ryan died while I was chasing the guy.
  </p>


<p>
In childhood house, where I lived with my parents now as an adult. My mom and
I were talking about Charlie Maier, who had mentioned to my mom he wanted to
show me all his trophies. I explain to her I am not impressed by trophies and
find them rather boring. I went to use the bathroom, but my brother had been
in their first and there was pee on the toilet seat (and lettuce pieces?) which
grossed me out. Went to my mom's room and asked if I could use her bathroom
and she said sure (absentmindedly, she was busy with something). In their
bathroom there was an old folks seat on the toilet and period like blood
floating in the toilet. I was frustrated and didn't use that bathroom either.
In my childhood bedroom my neighbor, Charlie Maier (prob don't use his full
name?),and I are talking in my room . We'd been hanging out (not looking at
trophies) and he's inching just a tad closer to me. He mentions how tidy my
room is and I get flustered at this compliment and mix up words. I try to scoop
 up a few loose gemstones (some are triangle shaped and pink but not in a
 noticeably gay way) and have to pick them up one by one. He is about to
 kiss me when a woman, Amy Vonnegut , walks in and she's an appointment he
 has for something he does for work. We have to back off to be professional.
 Charlie is leaned back on my floor and says, "before we decide when to see
 each other again, we should talk." I say okay. He says something to the effect
  of "you're too passive. If someone like Wisconsin (meaning my date there)
  says he believes trump should be president, you should say "hell no!"" In
  my head, I'm thinking about how my reaction would be to nod along and not
  rock the boat in that situation. "I'm aggressive when I need to be," I reply,
   not sure I believe what I'm saying. "But we should talk about this later.
   I could talk about this all day."

Woke up.

Was back in high school (but an adult again) and was late, trying desperately
 to get to a classroom where a test was taking place (sat 2's?). I walk through
  crowds of people and check my map a lot, finally matching building 333 to the
   number 333 on my map (no small feat in dreamland. I'm shocked I made it
   at all). I walk into the room and the students include high school people
   I knew. Candace Chang, Kevin Affleck, Kristin Dunn. Kevin says hi. I walk
   to the counter where he teacher tells me we aren't taking the test today
   and i almost cry with relief. I look for a seat and can't find one that
   isn't taken by someone who isn't sitting it in. The rows are small and my
   ass feels huge. I finally make it to a seat, but we aren't learning. We are
   taking turns pretending to try and give used things to our peers out of
    boxes, walking up and down the small isles with boxes of books - apparently
     this is what the administration wants to see so we have to pretend to do
      it. I take my turn with a heavy looking box that is light and then we
      are getting ready for a rummage sale. I talk to Kristin about what she's
      been up to, and the popular girls behind her leave the classroom with
      my friend Aubrey, but none of them talk to me. I find a gunny sack dress
       that I try on over my pullover sweater and ask Kristin if it fits. I
       want so much for it to. We drive a short way to Candace’s home where
       there is a pool. Candace grabs her stand up paddleboard. I get in he
       hot tub but remember I'm wearing a pad and get out. In the bathroom,
       where I've brought a tampon that is kept in a flossing box, tons of
       curtains cover Windows that look out.  I start trying to poop and make
       sure. No one can see me when my old boss. Matt Knudsen, starts knocking
       on the window to look in and be a joker. Later I talk to Candace about
       how much we feel different than we did and how we just want to leave
       high school and get our geds
       </p>

 Also haunting hallucination when I was young of two energy balls rolling down
  the hall towards my door. They made me so scared.</p>


<p>
There's a critical point in making any yeasty product -- letting/hoping the
dough rises. In my actual life, I was in the midst of making cinnamon buns.
Before going to bed, I had proofed yeast and formed and kneaded a dough. I
had put the dough in a bowl to rise and set that bowl in the microwave so it
could have some alone time to rise, or do its dough thing. I was a bit
skeptical of whether or not my yeast was still any good and wondering if my
dough would rise. Then I went to bed. That night I dreamed that my dough was
rising and rising and rising. At a very gradual but steady pace my dough was
getting bigger and bigger. My anxiety about leaving my dough unattended was also
 getting bigger and bigger. I'm not sure why, but I perseverated in thinking
 that the dough should rise more. It just wasn't ready. Or, I wasn't ready to
 part with it. Or, I developed some strange attachment to it. So, I took it
 everywhere I went. I took it to the grocery store and put the bowl in my
 shopping cart. I took it in the car to take on a camping trip. I took it on
 the back of my bike, which eventually needed to be upgraded to a kids bike
 trailer so it could come with me to work. Sean was partially on board and
 supportive but I suspected growing increasingly frustrated with my dough
 attachment. The dough was getting too big to live in a closet. Too big to
 fit in a car. Too big to fit in a backpacking pack. Then I woke up. When
 I went in the kitchen I found that the dough had risen. I rolled out the
 doll, shaped the cinnamon buns, and baked them. They were yummy.

I was getting acupuncture and I realized I could leave my body, so I did. I
left room and floated into a courtyard feeling both excited and very calm
about what was happening. I noticed the bricks and the landscaping and the muted
 light. Then I realized my session would be over soon and I should get back to
  my body or I’d lose it, something like death. When I returned, I realized
  I didn’t know how to get back in, which I thought was funny. None of this was
  frightening. I decided
    to lie on top of myself and shimmy and wiggle back into my body, and was
    overwhelmed with the sense of comfort I felt that I fit so well. I noted
    that my out-of-body elbows fit into my body-elbows like a key in a lock.
    It was deeply satisfying. Things went dark for a bit, then my acupuncturist,
     who somehow knew what had just happened, was ticking my neck and making
     crisp little whisper sounds in my ear, in the way that gives you the
     chills. I knew she was doing this because it was important to come back
     into your body through a small, focused area. When I was fully awake and
     gathering my things to leave, we had a little dispute about the ownership

     have a cat.

  complicated animated dream with vivian and ferris bueller
  ferris liked to dance and sing, worked for a powerful man. vivian was shy, but
  ferris got her a job. the Lord one day found an amazing set of art vivian had
  created and hid all his employee in the park to find the maker. vivian came
   late but the man didn't recognize her but ferris did.
  then there was a big fire and everyone got melted.<br>

  (I think Vivian was one of my employees at my first startup? So long I'm not
  sure)
  </p>

<p>I dreamed my parents were cool. They had sex on a bunk bed and my my mom came into
a napkin. I put it in my mouth to great applause. </p>

<p>No sword. More running and hiding. Panoramic alpine vista under the shade of a
cypres three. The sight of a speck in the air getting closer, the drawing realization
it's a dragon. Enter a small dose of fear, is it a good dragon or not?
It gets within range. It takes a huge inhalation. I start running. Gouts of flame
destroy the  tree. I run toward a gothic mansion that's suddenly handy and nearby.
There's a cellar door, the kind that's on the ground with hinge in the center and
two flap doors that open upwards. In snap the doors open and leap down the stairs.

Surprise! There are no stairs. I grab the ledge and dangle, nearly a literal
cliffhanger. I feel safe and hidden for a moment anyway and then the dragon shows its
beautiful, terrible face. Its shadow overwhelms me. It inhales hugely and let go
of the ledge, I fall. The flames move faster than gravity and I burn to death
instantaneously. I experience what death is like for a few timeless moments then I wake
up and go WHOA. </p>
<p>

I dreamt I was at a Broadway theatre with my Mother's friends, who were young again.
The show was comprised of the audience of thousands being invited on stage to dance
forever, surrounded by black cardboard buildings and a
 dark dusk backdrop. I wasn't picked because i hid my face.</p>

<p>
I have server dreams where the restaurant
is a stadium and I have like 300 people in my section and no one ever gets
anything.</p>


I am at a wooden board kneading marigold yellow pollen into dough made of
purple wheat. It is a course dough and there is pollen all over my lower arms
and wrists. My sister, ania, is standing slightly behind me watching with mild
disapproval but she doesn't say anything.</p>
