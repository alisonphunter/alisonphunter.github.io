    <p>
    I went to David Bowie's funeral. We were best friends. He rented out a huge
     synagogue in San Francisco and he knew he was dying so he went to his own
     funeral. He took a cyanide pill that would kill him in 15 minutes. He got
     into a cocoon like bed that was slowly raised vertically over the stage
     while his final song played and everyone watched him die. It was completely
     tragic and beautiful.
