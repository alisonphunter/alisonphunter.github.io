  <p>met a vc he took me in a ride in his car but he was driving crazy all up and
down this street, almost ran into a backhoe and was talking about money and i
was saying "I don't really care about the money" and then the meeting started
and todd siegel was there we were standing in a field and I was talking about
wanting to go to a water slide. it was a neat trick.<br> Later the VC sent me
an email and there was a still picture of that field and
embedded in the picture at exactly the right spot was a video of us all talking
(shot from the back so I didn't know we were being recorded) and I was talking
about the waterslide.</p>
