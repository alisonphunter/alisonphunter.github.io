        complicated animated dream with vivian and ferris bueller
        ferris liked to dance and sing, worked for a powerful man. vivian was shy, but
        ferris got her a job. the Lord one day found an amazing set of art vivian had
        created and hid all his employee in the park to find the maker. vivian came
         late but the man didn't recognize her but ferris did.
        then there was a big fire and everyone got melted.<br>

        (I think Vivian was one of my employees at my first startup? So long I'm not
        sure)
