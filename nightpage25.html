   Dream starts and I'm in a public bathroom in some mall area. A dude comes in
   and he's acting all sketchy, he's up to something. He goes into a stall and
   does something with stuff he brought in, then goes back out and I hear some
   kind of chaos. He made some kind of disturbance. He comes back in and shows
   me this thing that's like a shopping cart that he's modded to be a mechanical
    push rotating mop thing. It's weird. Anyhow, now the cops have the bathroom
    surrounded and I don't want them coming in because they'll get me too for
    something. So I pull out a big thing of smoke bombs and fireworks, have a lot
    of trouble getting it all lit at once but I do and toss it out the door. The
    dude and I slip out amid the chaos. At first we separate as we try to blend in,
     walking away from the scene.<br>
   There's cops all over the place though. We end up being near each other again
   and pushing through a crowd in some building. Cops have the building surrounded
    and as I go down the steps I realize we shouldn't be seen together, as the
    dude stands out in the crowd because he's black and we're in some kinda white
     suburban area, so I put my hand on the shoulder of a woman in front of me,
     hoping that she'll think I'm just using her for support because the crowd
     is pushing and shoving, but the cops will think I'm with her.<br>
   At some point I realize she's someone I know, a friend of a friend. She seems
   to get what I'm doing and pretends to be my lover as a show for the cops. We
   make out for a bit and slip by the cops. Later I'm at her apartment. We're
   still kind of going at it. Then the scene jumps and I'm at some club party,
   by myself. I'm taking photos, sitting on a couch and it's loud and people are
   dancing all over. I end up in some cuddle puddle with some people, make out
   with some girls, then go to leave. I end up having to go back in, because in
   typical dream fashion I realized I left without most of my clothes, so I
   wandered back in my boxers and gathered all my stuff.<br>
   I get back to that girl's apartment and there are cops all around it, but they
   seem to be focusing on a building next door so I slip in unnoticed. The girl
   isn't in there, but there are some people on the balcony overlooking the
   street. I get to the balcony and Toni is there with Jon Stewart and some other
   people. Jon asks me to get him a beer. They're watching the Extra Action
   Marching Band perform in the street. The band is mixed in with all the SWAT
   cops, going through their routine as they push through the cops. That's,
   unfortunately, when I wake up.<br>
