    Was back in high school (but an adult again) and was late, trying desperately
     to get to a classroom where a test was taking place (sat 2's?). I walk through
      crowds of people and check my map a lot, finally matching building 333 to the
       number 333 on my map (no small feat in dreamland. I'm shocked I made it
       at all). I walk into the room and the students include high school people
       I knew. Candace Chang, Kevin Affleck, Kristin Dunn. Kevin says hi. I walk
       to the counter where he teacher tells me we aren't taking the test today
       and i almost cry with relief. I look for a seat and can't find one that
       isn't taken by someone who isn't sitting it in. The rows are small and my
       ass feels huge. I finally make it to a seat, but we aren't learning. We are
       taking turns pretending to try and give used things to our peers out of
        boxes, walking up and down the small isles with boxes of books - apparently
         this is what the administration wants to see so we have to pretend to do
          it. I take my turn with a heavy looking box that is light and then we
          are getting ready for a rummage sale. I talk to Kristin about what she's
          been up to, and the popular girls behind her leave the classroom with
          my friend Aubrey, but none of them talk to me. I find a gunny sack dress
           that I try on over my pullover sweater and ask Kristin if it fits. I
           want so much for it to. We drive a short way to Candaceâ€™s home where
           there is a pool. Candace grabs her stand up paddleboard. I get in he
           hot tub but remember I'm wearing a pad and get out. In the bathroom,
           where I've brought a tampon that is kept in a flossing box, tons of
           curtains cover Windows that look out.  I start trying to poop and make
           sure. No one can see me when my old boss. Matt Knudsen, starts knocking
           on the window to look in and be a joker. Later I talk to Candace about
           how much we feel different than we did and how we just want to leave
           high school and get our geds
