There's a critical point in making any yeasty product -- letting/hoping the
dough rises. In my actual life, I was in the midst of making cinnamon buns.
Before going to bed, I had proofed yeast and formed and kneaded a dough. I
had put the dough in a bowl to rise and set that bowl in the microwave so it
could have some alone time to rise, or do its dough thing. I was a bit
skeptical of whether or not my yeast was still any good and wondering if my
dough would rise. Then I went to bed. That night I dreamed that my dough was
rising and rising and rising. At a very gradual but steady pace my dough was
getting bigger and bigger. My anxiety about leaving my dough unattended was also
 getting bigger and bigger. I'm not sure why, but I perseverated in thinking
 that the dough should rise more. It just wasn't ready. Or, I wasn't ready to
 part with it. Or, I developed some strange attachment to it. So, I took it
 everywhere I went. I took it to the grocery store and put the bowl in my
 shopping cart. I took it in the car to take on a camping trip. I took it on
 the back of my bike, which eventually needed to be upgraded to a kids bike
 trailer so it could come with me to work. Sean was partially on board and
 supportive but I suspected growing increasingly frustrated with my dough
 attachment. The dough was getting too big to live in a closet. Too big to
 fit in a car. Too big to fit in a backpacking pack. Then I woke up. When
 I went in the kitchen I found that the dough had risen. I rolled out the
 doll, shaped the cinnamon buns, and baked them. They were yummy.
