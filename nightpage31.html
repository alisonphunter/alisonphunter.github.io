    <p>No sword. More running and hiding. Panoramic alpine vista under the shade of a
cypres three. The sight of a speck in the air getting closer, the drawing realization
it's a dragon. Enter a small dose of fear, is it a good dragon or not?
It gets within range. It takes a huge inhalation. I start running. Gouts of flame
destroy the  tree. I run toward a gothic mansion that's suddenly handy and nearby.
There's a cellar door, the kind that's on the ground with hinge in the center and
two flap doors that open upwards. In snap the doors open and leap down the stairs.<br>

Surprise! There are no stairs. I grab the ledge and dangle, nearly a literal
cliffhanger. I feel safe and hidden for a moment anyway and then the dragon shows its
beautiful, terrible face. Its shadow overwhelms me. It inhales hugely and let go
of the ledge, I fall. The flames move faster than gravity and I burn to death
instantaneously. I experience what death is like for a few timeless moments then I wake
up and go WHOA. </p>
