I got Ryan Gratzer killed. We were riding bikes around LA and I said let's cut
 through this back area where there were hundreds of destitute homeless men
 lying on swampy grass. We retreated but a young man followed us and had a
 long carving knife attached to a piece of drywall. He attacked Ryan and I
  disarmed him but we both got stabbed. Ryan died while I was chasing the guy.
