  Strange Advice<br>
  July 12th, 2005<br>
  I dreamt that I was sneaking through Bill Gates’ house with a friend.
  We hadn’t been invited, but we hadn’t broken in and we hadn’t planned this
  adventure. (Looking back, I’m not sure how that could be. Perhaps we found
  a door that had been left open?)<br>

  As we slinked around this dark expensive house, Bill strode in and flicked on
  the lights. He didn’t seem surprised to see us. He offered us each a drink and
  showed us around the place a bit.<br>
  He said a few small-talk things. He glanced at me, offered me an opening to
  speak. I froze and couldn’t say anything. That’s what always happens when I’m
  face to face with a celebrity or a legend: I freeze up. Later I always kick
  myself because I didn’t say things that I should have.<br>
  As I pondered this Bill said:<br>
  “If you freeze up in front of a famous person and you know that later you’ll
  remember 100 things that you should have said, you should say:
  ‘I freeze up in front of famous people. Later I’ll think of 100 things that I
   should say now.   But I can’t say them now.’<br>
  That will break the roadblock.”<br>
  At “roadblock” I awakened with hot sunlight in my face.<br>
  I closed the blinds. I tried to go back to sleep and speak to Bill Gates but
  I couldn’t.<br>
  I’m not Bill’s biggest fan, but I’ll try those words next time I meet Jeff
  Bezos or Satan or Jesus.
