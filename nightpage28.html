    In childhood house, where I lived with my parents now as an adult. My mom and
    I were talking about Charlie Maier, who had mentioned to my mom he wanted to
    show me all his trophies. I explain to her I am not impressed by trophies and
    find them rather boring. I went to use the bathroom, but my brother had been
    in their first and there was pee on the toilet seat (and lettuce pieces?) which
    grossed me out. Went to my mom's room and asked if I could use her bathroom
    and she said sure (absentmindedly, she was busy with something). In their
    bathroom there was an old folks seat on the toilet and period like blood
    floating in the toilet. I was frustrated and didn't use that bathroom either.
    In my childhood bedroom my neighbor, Charlie Maier (prob don't use his full
    name?),and I are talking in my room . We'd been hanging out (not looking at
    trophies) and he's inching just a tad closer to me. He mentions how tidy my
    room is and I get flustered at this compliment and mix up words. I try to scoop
     up a few loose gemstones (some are triangle shaped and pink but not in a
     noticeably gay way) and have to pick them up one by one. He is about to
     kiss me when a woman, Amy Vonnegut , walks in and she's an appointment he
     has for something he does for work. We have to back off to be professional.
     Charlie is leaned back on my floor and says, "before we decide when to see
     each other again, we should talk." I say okay. He says something to the effect
      of "you're too passive. If someone like Wisconsin (meaning my date there)
      says he believes trump should be president, you should say "hell no!"" In
      my head, I'm thinking about how my reaction would be to nod along and not
      rock the boat in that situation. "I'm aggressive when I need to be," I reply,
       not sure I believe what I'm saying. "But we should talk about this later.
       I could talk about this all day."<br>  Woke up.
