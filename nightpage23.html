 <p>i was flying over a city, on some sort of boogieboard like craft, doing loops
and rolls, etc. Very fun. Then i landed near Sean Savage who was driving his
 RV. I got in the RV with him and Parker. We drove around and then Sean got
 stuck in a water fountain because he wasn't driving the RV very well. I
 got out with Parker to help him backup and stuff, but the RV kept getting
 worse. Running over people’s bikes and hitting cars, etc. Finally the RV drove
  forward and I saw Sean wasn't driving it anymore, it was some woman. She took
   off in the RV and Parker and I gave chase through crowded urban streets.
    After a long time of trying to figure out where the RV went (since it got
    away) we found it parked outside someone's house. We jumped in and started
    it up, and then saw the woman run out of the house and get in a little
    beater car and take off. I looked in the back of the RV and saw that my
    laptop (and Sean) were missing. I drove off in the RV to chase her, and
    it was a wild chase because it’s hard to chase a little car in an RV down
    steep curvy roads. I managed to keep up though, and she ended up doing a
    big loop and going back to her house. I parked and ran into the house to
    confront her. I was by myself now, Parker had disappeared somewhere when
    we were chasing the car. Inside she was pacing manically and muttering. I
    told her I wanted my laptop back, and she started talking some crazy stuff
     I didn't understand. When I looked at her, her face was multi-dimensional,
     fluttering, like I was on some kind of psychedelic drug that kept me from
     being able to focus on her face.  She seemed to be Vietnamese and seemed
     crazy like a bag lady. Then her two teenaged sons came out and joined in
     the confrontation. Out of nowhere one of the sons hit me with the neck,
     trying to stab me. He seemed to think he had sliced open my neck, but I
     thought I had blocked him before he could really do damage. Then he told
      me they'd already killed Sean, which pissed me off and I somehow didn't
      believe them. I started to fight back then, trying to kill the brothers,
      but woke up before it was resolved.
