<h1>ALISON P HUNTER</h1>

<h2>"Creativity often comes from survival skills, from having to solve problems in
inventive ways because you did not have more obvious means at your disposal.
Many people tend to associate creativity with freedom and moving laterally
across a field of possibilities; in fact, creativity is frequently a response
to limits and it usually demands a vertical, deeper incursion into the
material.‚Äù<br> Enrique Martin&eacute;z Celaya </h2>
