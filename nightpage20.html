  "Go tell 'em girl" my great-grandmother kept telling me. I hadn't seen her since
  I was five years old and she died when I was twelve, but here she was standing
  behind my nineteen year old self just before that night.<br>

  I almost didn't do it. I almost kept that secret to myself, but great-grandma
  kept pushing me. She was excitable, she was concerned, she was loving. I was
  scared. I held to the secret for so long, I didn't know how to let it out.<br>

  "Do it now girl, do it now" she whispered as she laid her warm, but firm
  hands on my shoulders. </p>
